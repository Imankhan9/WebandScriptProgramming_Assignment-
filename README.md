# WebandScriptProgramming_Assignment-

The website adaps to different screen sizes using different css file for each. The phone.css uses <=480px, the tablet.css uses 481px-960, and the full.css uses >=960px.


I applied linear gradient to the body element which went from  #CC9BA8 to #33161. 

From the adoble color webiste I used monochromatic harmony. Which included, #CC9BA8, #998187, #FF8EAC, #7A6D71, #33161E. I used these colors throughout the whole portfolio, including in the linear gradient.
